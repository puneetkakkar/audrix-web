# Audrix (Music Recommendation System)

One of the major problems of recommender systems in general, and music recommender systems in particular is the cold start problem, i.e., when a new user registers to the system or a new item is added to the catalog and the system does not have sufficient data associated with these items/users. In such a case, the system cannot properly recommend existing items to a new user (new user problem) or recommend a new item to the existing users
